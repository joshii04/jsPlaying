                -------- COURSE 2 NOTES --------

Strongly type languages:
    demand the specifications of types!
        EG: typescript

Looselt typed langaues: 
    do not need types specified!
        EG: js
            AKA: weakly typed

TS is statically typed: 
    This means types are checked at
    compile time

        WHEREAS

    JS is dynamically typed lang
    This means types are checked at 
    run time. 

TS bennefits: 

    Self documenting
    Catch errors in development 
    Great for teams
