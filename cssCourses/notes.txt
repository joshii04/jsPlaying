BLOCK: Whole section

INLINE: Stack more in-line until can't fit and then move to next
        row

RELATIVE: Does not remove elements from the document flow
            EG: still exists in the area so other things 
                don't slide in.

ABSOLUTE: - Always working with 2 elements. 
          - Moves from parent offset. 
          - Parent = Relative: set parent to relative
          - Absolute = child of relative object
          - Elements with absoulyte positioning
            are removed from the document flow

FIXED: - Always fixed according to the viewport
       - Moves with the browser window
       - Will be at the front
       - Removed from doc flow and other elements will
         slide in.

STICKY: - Slides up until condition met
            EG: top 0;

       - 0 = off 1 = on (ratios)

(display) WRAP - Fixes the overflow issue

> * - Select all children
    - EG; 
        .columns{
          display: flex;
          gap: 2rem;
        }

        .columns > *{
          flex-shrink: 0;
        }

FLEX: 1 - All equal sizes of stuff within a row
FLEX-BASIS: 0 (better)
        - Does the same thing
        - Sets all items to equal width and height
        - EG; 
            flex-basis: 300px 

JUSTIFY CONTENT - Only works if you have extra space within the parent class 

FLEX-START - Push elements to the start of the parent class
FLEX-END - To end
